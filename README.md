## openshift-ansible-bootstrap

A way to bootstrap my nodes before an openshift-ansible install

## Usage

### Step 0: Modify the inventory 

Modify the `./inventory/inventory` to meet your needs.


### Step 1: Attach disks to VMs

Note that the the list of `virtual_machines` in the inventory are the names that `virsh` sees in order to attach disks ()

    ansible-playbook -i inventory/inventory vm-disks.yaml

### Step 2: Bootstrap openshift nodes with Docker setup

**NOTE**: This **will remove all Docker everything!**

    Â ansible-playbook -i inventory/inventory bootstrap.yml
